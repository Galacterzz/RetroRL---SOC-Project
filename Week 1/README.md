# WEEK 1
In this week I learned about basic premise and idea behing RL. Started with MAB then learned concepts like Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and Dynammic Programming.
Below is the activities done in Week 1:
- Report About things I learned in Week 1   --> [Report](https://github.com/Galacterzz/RetroRL---SOC-Project/blob/45afc10fda0162214fb6788d73b708ccf2b7636e/Week%201/Report%20Week%201.pdf)
- MAB problem using Epsilon Greedy Strategy --> [MAB 1](https://github.com/Galacterzz/RetroRL---SOC-Project/blob/45afc10fda0162214fb6788d73b708ccf2b7636e/Week%201/epsilon%20greedy%20MAB.ipynb) 
- MAB problem using UCB strategy            --> [MAB 2](https://github.com/Galacterzz/RetroRL---SOC-Project/blob/45afc10fda0162214fb6788d73b708ccf2b7636e/Week%201/UCB%20MAB.ipynb)
- Simple Implementation of Cartpole in GYM  --> [CartPole](https://github.com/Galacterzz/RetroRL---SOC-Project/blob/45afc10fda0162214fb6788d73b708ccf2b7636e/Week%201/Cartpole%20basic%20implementation.ipynb)
